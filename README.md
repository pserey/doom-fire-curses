# Doom Fire in Curses
![](https://i.imgur.com/E3MOCxC.gif)

I implemented the fire rendering algorithm from Doom in python curses. It uses an ASCII characters gradient palette. 

I've read about the algorithm but never tought of implementing it until I saw [@felipedeschamps](https://github.com/filipedeschamps)'s [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fxm8cadCqbs&) about it. And since I've been wanting to learn about python curses, here it is.

My first contact with the algorithm was [here](https://fabiensanglard.net/doom_fire_psx/) in Fabien Sanglard's Website.

# Running in your terminal
For getting it running in your terminal make sure to zoom out, else it might return an error!

Besides that, you just have to download and run it with Python 3. No extra libraries needed.
```
python3 doom-fire.py
```
